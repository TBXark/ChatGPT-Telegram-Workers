1. Add the following Secrets to the Github repository's Settings -> Secrets
    - CF_API_TOKEN: Your Cloudflare API TOKEN
    - WRANGLER_TOML: The full content of the wrangler.toml file. Refer to [wrangler-example.toml](../../wrangler-example.toml) for an example.
    - CF_WORKERS_DOMAIN (optional): Your Cloudflare Workers route (the value of your *.workers.dev in the Workers route, without https://)
2. Enable Actions in the Github repository's Settings -> Actions


## 4. Synchronize my repository
1. For security reasons, the repository you forked will not automatically sync with my repository. Therefore, you need to manually sync with my repository.
2. When you manually sync with my repository, your repository will automatically trigger the Action and deploy automatically.
3. If you want to skip this step, you can add an Action to automatically sync with my repository.
    1. Create a file in your repository named: `.github/workflows/sync.yml`
    2. Copy the following content to the file.
    3. The code below has not been tested and is for reference only.
    ```yml
    name: Sync
    on:
      schedule:
        - cron: '0 0 * * *'
    jobs:
        sync:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
            - name: Sync
                uses: repo-sync/github-sync@v2
                with:
                source_repo: 'https://github.com/TBXark/ChatGPT-Telegram-Workers'
                target_repo: 'Fill in your repository address'
                github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} 
                source_branch: 'master'
   ```
