# Configuration

It is recommended to fill in environment variables in the Workers configuration interface, rather than directly modifying variables in the JS code.

### Group Configuration
You can add the bot to a group, and then everyone in the group can chat with the bot.
> BREAKING CHANGE:
> Major changes, you must add the group ID to the whitelist `CHAT_GROUP_WHITE_LIST` to use it, otherwise anyone can add your bot to the group and consume your quota.

> IMPORTANT: Due to the privacy and security policies of restricted Telegram groups, if your group is a public group or has more than 2000 people, please set the bot as `administrator`, otherwise the bot will not respond to chat messages with `@bot`.

> IMPORTANT：Must set `/setprivacy` to `disable` in botfather, otherwise the bot will not respond to chat messages with `@bot`.
